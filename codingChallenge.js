/*1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The method does 2 things:
  1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the selected option. The prompt should look like this:
        What is your favourite programming language?
        0: JavaScript
        1: Python
        2: Rust
        3: C++
        (Write option number)
  
  1.2. Based on the input number, update the answers array. For example, if the option is 3, increase the value AT POSITION 3 of the array by 1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes sense (e.g answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string' or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1". 
4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each 'registerNewAnswer' method call.

HINT: Use many of the tools you learned about in this and the last section ðŸ˜‰

BONUS: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do NOT put the arrays in the poll object! So what shoud the this keyword look like in this situation?

BONUS TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 3]
BONUS TEST DATA 2: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1]

// Coding Challenge #2

/* 
Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study.

Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:

1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old, humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4.
2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)
3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know from other challenges how we calculate averages ðŸ˜‰)
4. Run the function for both test datasets

TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]

*/

const calcAverageHumanAge = function (ages) {

  let humanAges = ages.map((dogAge) => {
    if (dogAge <= 2) return dogAge * 2;
    else return 16 + dogAge * 4;
  });
  humanAges = humanAges.filter((age) => age >= 18);
  const humanAvgAge = humanAges.reduce((acc, age) => acc + age, 0);
  console.log(humanAvgAge / humanAges.length);

}
calcAverageHumanAge([5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]);
